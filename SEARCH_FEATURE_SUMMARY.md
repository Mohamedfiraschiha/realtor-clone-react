## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Frontend Components

1. **`AdvancedSearch.jsx`** - Main search component with filters
2. **`SearchResults.jsx`** - Display search results page
3. **`Home.jsx`** - Added AdvancedSearch component
4. **`App.js`** - Added /search route
5. **`config.js`** - Added SEARCH endpoint

### Backend API

1. **`backend/app/api/listings/search/route.js`** - Search endpoint with MongoDB queries

## 🎯 How to Use

### User Flow:

1. User opens the homepage
2. Sees the Advanced Search component below the slider
3. Enters search criteria (location, price, bedrooms, etc.)
4. Clicks "Search Properties"
5. Redirected to `/search` with results
6. Can save the search for later use
7. Can load/delete saved searches

### Example Search:

```
Location: "New York"
Type: "rent"
Min Price: "1000"
Max Price: "3000"
Bedrooms: "2+"
Sort By: "Price: Low to High"
```

## 🔧 Backend Query Logic

The search API builds dynamic MongoDB queries:

- Location searches across `address`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode`
- Price filters check both `regularPrice` and `discountedPrice`
- Bedrooms/bathrooms use `$gte` (greater than or equal)
- Results limited to 50 listings
- Full query logging for debugging

## 🚀 Next Steps to Enhance

1. **Add autocomplete for location** (Google Places API)
2. **Implement pagination** for large result sets
3. **Add more filters**: square footage, parking, amenities
4. **Email alerts** for saved searches when new listings match
5. **Recently viewed** properties tracking
6. **Search history** in addition to saved searches

## 💡 Tips

- Saved searches persist in browser localStorage
- Clear filters by refreshing or creating a new search
- Backend supports complex queries combining multiple filters
- All filters are optional - blank search returns all listings
